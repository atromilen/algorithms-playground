## Algorithms List
1.[Euclidean Algorithm](src/cl/atromilen/algorithms/EuclidesAlgorithm.java): Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can know 
how to get the _Greater Common Divisor (GCD)_ between 2 numbers. In other words, we can obtain the smallest possible 
value to divide 2 numbers. Think in a plot of 1680 * 640 than we need to divide in identical squares. How can we 
determine the smallest square (80) to divide the plot? Things like this we can solve using Euclidean algorithm.
Take a look at this very good explanation about this algorithm
[here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm).

2.[Quicksort](src/cl/atromilen/algorithms/Quicksort.java): In this example, we are ordering a list of N elements using
this sorting algorithm, using techniques such as Divide & Conquer and Recursion. In this example we are using a basic
pivot (the first element), but in the way we will improve this algorithm.
